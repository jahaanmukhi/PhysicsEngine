# PhysicsEngine
Developed a Physics Engine capable of detecting and resolving collisions between Convex Polygons. From scratch.

Throughout my journey into game development, I was always intrigued by the algorithms you seem to take for granted. How by the simple call of a method, you could detect when your body was colliding with a wall or an enemy. 
So, last summer I decided to delve into the Physics of it all, and write my own implementation of a Physics engine to better understand the mechanics of what was going on in premade game engines.
